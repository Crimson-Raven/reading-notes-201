### Lab 14-2

### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
Shared trust and respect: Team members need to feel comfortable taking risks, sharing ideas, and admitting mistakes without fear of judgment or ridicule. This foundation of trust and respect allows individuals to be authentic and vulnerable, fostering open communication and collaboration. Building trust involves consistent actions, open dialogue, demonstrating reliability and integrity, and valuing diverse perspectives.
Open communication and psychological safety: When communication is open and honest, team members feel comfortable expressing their opinions, concerns, and ideas, even if they differ from the majority.  Psychological safety encourages this open communication by ensuring individuals feel safe from negative consequences for speaking up. Leaders can promote this by actively listening to all voices, acknowledging contributions, and avoiding shooting down ideas prematurely.
Focus on learning and growth: Psychologically safe teams view mistakes and challenges as opportunities for learning and growth. This fosters a culture where individuals are encouraged to experiment, take risks, and learn from their experiences. Leaders can promote this by providing constructive feedback, celebrating successes and failures equally, and creating an environment where learning and improvement are valued over perfectionism.
### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
Honestly, a professional setting that cares about employees and their wellbeing seems to be harder to find these days. The only example I have is for one specific manager at the hospital I worked for. I was struggling in my personal/home life and she offered a great deal of empathy while still pushing me to grow as an employee. She was the only boss I had worked for in my life so far that I really felt respected and cared about me as a human being, and not just a paycheck or a number. It feels like a lot of companies these days are robotic, and cold. As long as you come in and do your job, that’s the limit of what they care about. Nothing else matters to them, you’re replaceable. Especially if you have a condition like chronic migraines, in my experience, they’ll just let you go, even if you’re going to doctors to find a solution. Also the amount of sexual harassment that goes on in the working world is insane, and you’ll most likely get fired for speaking up about it, too. I’m not trying to sound pessimistic or anything, this is just my personal experience so far. Companies don’t take psychological safety seriously, in my opinion. 
### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
Companies experience:
Increased innovation and problem-solving
Improved decision-making
Higher employee engagement and satisfaction
Team members enjoy:
Increased well-being and mental health
Greater sense of belonging and connection
Enhanced learning and development
Boosted sense of purpose and meaning

## Things I want to learn more about:
Why don't companies push the importance of psychological safety more? It's like everyone talks about how important it is, but nobody actually care about it enough to impliment it in their companies.
