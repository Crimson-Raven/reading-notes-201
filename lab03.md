### What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
Help desk professionals are the first line of support for the customer who is having technical issues. 
### The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
Hard skills are specific, measurable skills, like configuring and troubleshooting systems. Soft skills refer to the ability to communicate clearly with others. In short, hard skills can often get you an interview while soft skills can get you the job.
When I worked as a security guard, the hard skills that were highly valued were security skills, business skills, and troubleshooting skills. The soft skills that got me the job in security were communication skills, personal skills, writing skills, and training skills. I had the experience and knowledge to understand how to do the job well, which qualified me for an interview, as well as having the charisma and desire to provide great customer service, and become a valuable asset to the company that landed me the job. 
### Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?
Security skills have become more important for help desk technicians to have because cyber attacks, and phishing scams have become more frequent and sophisticated. Itâ€™s important for technicians to understand this so they can educate people on how to protect themselves and avoid them. 
### How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?
Writing and critical thinking skills are important for help desk technicians to have because they need to clearly explain technical issues to users that are tech savvy, as well as those who are not. They also need to analyze each problem, identify its root cause, and determine the most effective solution.
