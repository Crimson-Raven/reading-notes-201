### What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
If multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting, it’s important to break each issue down into an individual issue, and then troubleshoot them separately and one at a time. 
### What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
After identifying a successful solution you should implement said solution. Even the best plans don't always work as expected though. It’s not only good to have a primary plan of how to resolve this, but also a Plan B or Plan C. And ultimately, you may need a plan to revert back to the previous configuration if nothing goes right.
### What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
It’s important you document your troubleshooting process, so you can look back on it if you need to reference what you did to solve the issue in the future. If anyone else ever runs across the same issues, then this can also be helpful for them to look back on as well.
### Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-user’s cultural background?
If someone came to me and said their android wasn’t turning on I would take these following steps to troubleshoot: Describe the problem, ask the user questions about what’s going on and when it started, observe the device, identify is there are any hardware or software issues, make a plan for a solution, implement successful solution, and confirm that the solution fixed the issue.
