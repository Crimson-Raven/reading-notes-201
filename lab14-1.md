### Lab 14-1

### What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?
Antivirus is primarily focused on protecting against established threats like viruses, worms, and Trojans. These are well-known and have defined characteristics that antivirus programs can identify and block.
Anti-malware offers a broader scope of protection, encompassing newer and emerging threats beyond just viruses. This includes things like ransomware, spyware, adware, and even zero-day attacks (previously unknown vulnerabilities).
### What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?
Slow performance: Your computer may suddenly run slower than usual, taking longer to boot up, open programs, or perform tasks.
Frequent freezing or crashing: Unexpected crashes or freezes can be signs of malware interfering with your system's normal operations.
Pop-ups and unwanted ads: An increase in pop-up ads, especially from unfamiliar sources, could be a sign of adware infection.
Browser changes: Your web browser's homepage or default search engine might change without your permission, often redirecting you to malicious websites.
New toolbars or extensions: Unfamiliar toolbars or extensions appearing in your browser could be installed by malware to track your browsing activity or inject ads.
Unexplained programs: You may notice new programs or applications running on your computer that you don't remember installing.
### Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.
A full scan is for a deep clean of your system, especially after potential exposure or for regular maintenance (weekly recommended).
A quick scan is for frequent checkups to catch actively running threats or recent infections.
### What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?
Disconnect from the internet:  Immediately disconnect your computer from the internet (Wi-Fi and ethernet) to prevent the ransomware from spreading to other devices on your network or further encrypting your files.
Isolate the infected device: If you have other devices connected to the same network, turn them off and disconnect them from the network as well. This helps prevent the ransomware from infecting other devices.
Don't pay the ransom: Paying the ransom is not recommended for several reasons:
There's no guarantee: Even if you pay, there's no guarantee that you'll get your files back. The attackers may not decrypt your files, or the decryption tool they provide may not work.
Encourages the attackers: Paying the ransom only encourages the attackers to continue their activities and target other victims.
Law enforcement: Reporting the attack to law enforcement helps them track down the attackers and potentially recover stolen data.
Back up your data (if possible): If you haven't already, do not back up your data to the infected device. This could encrypt your backup as well. However, if you have a recent and uninfected backup on an external drive, you can use it to recover your files.
Scan your computer for malware: Use your antivirus or anti-malware software to scan your computer and try to remove the ransomware. Some antivirus programs may have specific tools for decrypting ransomware.
Look for decryption tools: There are free decryption tools available online for some strains of ransomware. You can search for the specific ransomware variant you encountered (information might be available in the ransom note) to see if there's a decryption tool available. Be cautious when downloading tools from untrusted sources, and only download from reputable security websites.
Report the attack: Report the ransomware attack to the authorities, such as the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in the US or your local law enforcement agency. This helps them track the attackers and potentially develop future solutions.
Reinstall your operating system (if necessary): If you cannot remove the ransomware or recover your files, you may need to reinstall your operating system. This will erase all data on your computer, including your personal files, so ensure you have a backup if possible.
### Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?
Windows: The emphasis on third-party software in Windows reflects a market-driven approach, with users relying on external solutions for protection, similar to how they might choose various software applications for other needs.
macOS: The focus on built-in security features in macOS aligns with Apple's emphasis on user experience and ease of use. It aims to provide a more seamless and controlled environment for users.
Linux: The reliance on community and open-source tools in Linux reflects the collaborative and self-reliant values often associated with the Linux user base. Users are expected to have a certain level of technical knowledge and actively participate in maintaining their systems' security.
